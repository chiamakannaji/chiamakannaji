Derivatives are powerful tool that not only tell you how a function changes, but can also tell you the value of a variable for which a function reaches a maximum or minimum value as the derivative will be equal to 0. The slope of a line is another example of a derivative as it is the change in y over the change in x.\n","\n","Formally, the equation for the derivative of a Function is written as:\n","\n","$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$\n","\n","Here is an example of a visualization to determine the maximum/minimum of a function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SwhprlX7IgH_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612786005177,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":349,"user":{"displayName":"Usama Bari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi63QYmB0IpHlTGDpnIp177mO5UfCMQzxIj0VkiwQ=s64","userId":"15037366419685538600"}}},"source":["# Don't worry about the package imports for now.\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Here, I define a function in python where f(x) = 9 - (x-3)^2\n","def f(x):\n","  return 9 - (x-3)**2\n","\n","# Here, I define the derivative function as f' or fprime.\n","def fprime(x):\n","  h = 1e-5\n","  return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h\n","\n","x = np.linspace(-3,9,19)\n","\n","fig, axs = plt.subplots(2)\n","plt.figure(figsize=(30,20))\n","fig.suptitle('Plots of the function f(x) and its derivative, fprime(x)')\n","axs[0].plot(x, f(x))\n","axs[1].plot(x, fprime(x))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GcmhiegeCg92"},"source":["At the value of x = 3, our function f(x), reaches its maximum value of 9 whereas our derivative hits a value of 0 at x = 3.

Rather than the slope of a curve, the integral is the area underneath the curve.
